This is an assignment for my CS Algorithms and Analysis.

Here we are asked to implement a solution to solve Sudoku and Killer Sudoku puzzles using various algorithms.
The main challenge of the assignment is to implement various algorithms and compare their complexities,
and ensure that the algorithms are as efficient as possible.


Outcome: High Distinction :)
